Rank Pro Production: Most desirable
- Position
- Value within position 

Want to calc value, and then adjust by position value, bc position 
value likely to change quicker due to market/draft conditions 

Model pro value as a beta distribution



-Only keeping first four years (rookie contract)

Main Designs:
1) How do we determine our 'outcome' variable?
There are two routes we can go down:
    - a "Did he 'make' it in the NFL", more games-played style metric
    - solely "how well did he play in the games he played in" to determine value 
Like it or not, if we think of the NFL market as liquid (opinion can vary), for 
draft picks, we actually care more about if they play a lot than if they're good. 

But, do some linear combination of the two

2) How should we weight NFL seasons
Should we treat each season equally, or weight later seasons more
